## Key Improvements

### 1. Smooth Scrolling Navigation
- All stats cards (Network Requests, Console Errors, Token Events) are now clickable.
- Clicking a card smoothly scrolls to the corresponding table section using `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'start' })`.
- Section IDs (`network-requests-section`, `console-errors-section`, `token-events-section`) added for scroll targets.
- Visual feedback: cursor pointer and shadow transition on hover.

### 2. Enhanced Network Requests Table
- **New Columns Added:**
  - **Initiator Type:** Shows request initiator (script, parser, fetch, etc.) with color-coded badges.
  - **Referrer/Origin:** Displays the origin domain or 'Direct' indicator for requests without referrer.
  - **Headers Preview:** Smart preview of important headers (authorization, content-type, user-agent, accept). Truncates sensitive data and shows header count if no important headers.
  - **Response Time:** Color-coded performance indicator (green <100ms, yellow <500ms, orange <1000ms, red >1000ms).
- All new columns are sortable for easier analysis.
- Table cells use truncation and tooltips for better readability.

### 3. Token Events Table Enhancements
- Added columns for Token Type, Event Description, Obfuscated Token ID, and Expiry Time.
- Improved filtering and sorting for token events.
- Enhanced empty state messaging for clarity.

### 4. UI/UX Cleanup
- Removed Quick Actions and Recent Activity sections for a cleaner dashboard.
- Consistent styling and responsive design across all tables and cards.
- Improved hover effects and transitions for interactive elements.

### 5. Data Model Updates
- Updated `ApiCall` interface in `src/background/storage-types.ts` to support new fields:
  - `initiator_type`, `referrer`, `response_time` (all optional)
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing data.

### 6. Build & Commit
- Verified successful build with `npm run build`.
- All changes committed with a detailed message:
  - "feat: Complete dashboard improvements with smooth scrolling and enhanced network requests table"
