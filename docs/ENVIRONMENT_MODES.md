## How to Switch Modes

### 1. **Development Mode**
- Use for local development, debugging, and testing.
- Includes source maps, verbose logging, and debug features.
- Uses settings from `.env`.

**To build in development mode:**
```powershell
$env:NODE_ENV = "development"; npm run build
```
Or simply run:
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### 2. **Production Mode**
- Use for final builds to distribute or publish.
- Optimized, minified, excludes debug features and source maps.
- Uses settings from `.env.production` (if present).

**To build in production mode:**
```powershell
$env:NODE_ENV = "production"; npm run build
```
Or use the provided script:
```powershell
./build-production.ps1
```

| Minification          | Disabled                | Enabled                   |
| Performance Metrics   | Enabled (if set in .env)| Disabled (if set in .env.production) |
| Storage Logs          | Enabled (if set in .env)| Disabled (if set in .env.production) |

## Environment Files
- `.env` â€” Used for development mode
- `.env.production` â€” Used for production mode

Set your feature flags and storage options in these files to control behavior for each mode.

---

## Summary
- **Switch modes by setting `NODE_ENV` before building.**
- **Development mode** is for debugging and testing.
- **Production mode** is for optimized, user-ready builds.
- **Environment files** let you control features and logging for each mode.
