# 🚨 IMPORTANT: Extension Update Required

## ❗ **Current Issue**
You're testing with an **old version** of the extension that still has CSP violations. The logs show:

```
🔄 CONTENT: Starting direct script injection...
Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive...
```

But the **latest code** uses web_accessible_resources and should show:
```
🔄 CONTENT: Starting web-accessible script injection...
🌍 MAIN-WORLD: External script loaded into main world
```

## ✅ **Solution: Update Your Extension**

### **Step 1: Fresh Build Completed**
✅ `npm run build` just completed successfully
✅ Extension files are ready in the `dist` folder

### **Step 2: Update Extension in Chrome**
1. **Open Chrome Extensions**: Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Find your extension**: Look for "Web App Monitor"
3. **Click the refresh/reload button** ↻ on your extension card
4. **OR remove and reinstall**:
   - Click "Remove"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `dist` folder

### **Step 3: Test on Fresh Reddit Tab**
1. **Open a new Reddit tab** (don't refresh the old one)
2. **Open DevTools → Console**
3. **Look for these NEW logs**:

```
✅ CONTENT: Script loaded on: https://www.reddit.com/...
📍 CONTENT: Is Reddit? true
✅ CONTENT: Chrome APIs available
🌍 CONTENT: Injecting main world network interception...
🔄 CONTENT: Starting web-accessible script injection...
🌍 MAIN-WORLD: External script loaded into main world
🌍 MAIN-WORLD: Original fetch captured: function
✅ CONTENT: Web-accessible script loaded successfully
✅ CONTENT: Direct script injection successful
🌍 MAIN-WORLD: Network interception active in main world
```

### **Step 4: Run Debug Script**
Copy and paste this into the console:
```javascript
// Paste the debug script content here
```

**Expected Results:**
```
✅ Extension network interception: ACTIVE
🌐 Fetch function status: INTERCEPTED ✅
✅ TEST RESULT: Network interception is WORKING!
🎉 NETWORK INTERCEPTION: FULLY FUNCTIONAL!
```

## 🔍 **How to Verify You Have the Latest Version**

### ❌ **Old Version (CSP Violation):**
- Shows "Starting direct script injection"
- CSP error about inline scripts
- Network interception NOT ACTIVE

### ✅ **New Version (CSP Compliant):**
- Shows "Starting web-accessible script injection"
- No CSP errors
- Shows "MAIN-WORLD: External script loaded"
- Network interception ACTIVE

## 🎯 **Critical Steps**

1. **Reload Extension** ↻ in Chrome Extensions
2. **Open NEW Reddit tab** (old tabs use cached code)
3. **Check console logs** for "web-accessible script injection"
4. **No CSP errors** should appear

**The extension is ready - you just need to update it in Chrome!** 🚀

**Next**: After updating, you should see the new logs and working network interception without any CSP violations.
